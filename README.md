# Aadhaar Inclusion Stress Index (AISI)

📊 **UIDAI Data Hackathon 2026 Project**

The **Aadhaar Inclusion Stress Index (AISI)** is a data-driven framework designed to measure **digital inclusion stress** across Indian states and districts using Aadhaar enrollment data.

This project identifies regions where Aadhaar services face higher inclusion challenges and provides actionable insights for policy planning and intervention.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Create a composite **Inclusion Stress Index**
- Identify **High, Medium, and Low stress districts**
- Analyze Aadhaar enrollment imbalance across age groups
- Enable **data-driven governance decisions**
- Build a **live analytical dashboard** using Streamlit

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

AISI is calculated using:
- Age-group based Aadhaar enrollment data
- Child-to-total enrollment ratio
- District-level aggregation
- Stress classification (Low / Medium / High)

This helps detect **under-enrollment and demographic imbalance** in Aadhaar coverage.
